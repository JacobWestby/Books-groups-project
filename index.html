        <b>Hello there!</b>

        <p>Do you need a good book to be able to relax after a stressfull day?<br>
           Have you found a mysterius mushroom or insect and want to know what it is?<br>
           Do you want to know everything about trees and our ecosystem?<br>
           Then you have come to the right place!<br>
           We focus on literature that provides fun and educational knowledge.<br>
            We're working with the aim of generating money for Bird Protection and Conservation, where all surplus 
            goes to the institute's work with various measures to prevent red-listed and threatened bird species from 
            declining or disappearing from our fauna. We also serve to provide our members the best products for a greater 
            experience in nature. We know that an extensive bird-protection programme gives advantages for other groups of 
            organisms than birds alone – that’s why we hold our range of products as wide as possible for all people interested 
            in the diverse nature around us.</p>
